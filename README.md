## Installation

### Prerequisites
To run NeuroForge, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- `Python >= 3.8`
- `Streamlit`
- `TensorFlow`
- `OpenCV`
- `Numpy`

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuroforge.git
   ```
2. Change directory to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd neuroforge
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser to view the app at `http://localhost:8501`.
3. Upload a video file (supported formats: mp4, avi, mov, mkv, mpeg) and start the analysis.
4. The app will display a real-time confidence score, classification as "Real" or "Fake," and detailed explanations if inconsistencies are detected.

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- `streamlit`
- `tensorflow`
- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `requests` (for fetching animations or external resources)

### Model Architecture
